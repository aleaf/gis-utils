gis-utils
-----------------------------------------------
Convenience functions for working with geospatial data in python. The python geospatial stack (`fiona`, `shapely`, `rasterio`, `pyproj`, `rtree`, and others) combined with `numpy` and `pandas` provides enormous power and flexibility for geospatial analysis. However, common geoprocessing tasks often require several lines of boiler-plate code that can be tedious, repetitive and difficult to remember. `gis-utils` aims to distill these operations into simple, robust functions that can be imported into any workflow, to reduce cognitive load and allow effort to be focused on the more important parts of the analysis.
